On April 24, 1889, McAleer broke into the Major Leagues in Cleveland, Ohio, where he established a reputation as a graceful outfielder.[7] In 1891, when Patsy Tebeau became manager of the Cleveland Spiders, the club became known for its aggressive tactics.[7] Tebeau encouraged players to block and hold runners, while he himself openly challenged and harassed officials. In 1896, the Cleveland manager was jailed for attacking an umpire who "decided it was too dark to continue a game".[7] On June 27, 1896, McAleer was among several Cleveland players to be fined by a Louisville (Kentucky) judge for their role in the incident.[7] Later that year, the club's notoriety prompted other National League teams to propose a boycott of Cleveland, "until the Spiders mended their ways."[7] McAleer's periodic displays of temper were in keeping with this rowdy environment. During an August 18, 1891 game with the Cincinnati Reds, Reds player Arlie Latham tripped McAleer as he rounded third base; McAleer responded by chasing Latham around the field, while brandishing his bat.[2]
At the same time, McAleer proved a strong performer.[4] A later newspaper account described him as an outstanding outfielder who was "blessed with excellent speed".[4] The article noted that McAleer's skills as a sprinter helped him steal 51 bases in one year and 41 in another.[4] According to some accounts, he was "the first centerfielder to take his eyes off a fly ball, run to the spot where it fell to earth, and catch it".[8] Less proficient as a hitter, McAleer accumulated a lifetime batting average of .253.[4] During his career, the league's batting (pitchers removed) average for players with the same home field was .284.[9] On April 24, 1894, he assisted in Cleveland's 1–0 victory over Cincinnati with a single in the ninth that drove home Buck Ewing, who had doubled.[2] Along with teammates Cy Young, Jesse Burkett, John Clarkson, and Charles Zimmer, McAleer also participated in the Spiders' victory over the Baltimore Orioles in the 1895 Temple Cup, a post-season series between first and second-place teams of the National League.[7] The Spiders placed second to the Orioles at the close of both the 1895 and 1896 seasons.[7] McAleer's performance came in spite of a serious injury he received during a game held in Philadelphia on August 24, 1895, when he collided with a fence.[10] Furthermore, he balanced his achievements in sports with a foray into politics in his hometown of Youngstown. During the summer of 1895, McAleer was promoted in the local media as a mayoral candidate, first as a Republican,[11] and then as an independent.[12] Further research is required to determine the depth of his involvement in politics.
In 1898, when the Spiders' owners purchased the St. Louis Browns franchise, McAleer opted to stay in Cleveland, taking a brief hiatus from baseball until the Cleveland Blues franchise joined the newly formed American League (AL).[2] During his two-year absence, the Spiders lost many of their more experienced players.[13] In 1899, the team won 20 games and lost 134, which is still percentage-wise the worst season record in Major League history.[13] As baseball historian Bill James noted, the Spiders were forced to cancel home games due to poor attendance and "turned the last two months of the season into a long road trip".[14] After a full year out of baseball in 1899, McAleer was back in a Cleveland uniform in 1900, in a new league, as player-manager of the Cleveland Lake Shores of the fledgling American League, then a minor league. McAleer's subsequent career as a major league manager (1901–1911) overlapped with his playing career (1882–1907). Although he did not play professionally between 1903 and 1906, McAleer played in his last Major League game on July 8, 1907.[9]
