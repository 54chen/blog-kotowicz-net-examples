Congratulations! You broke the unbreakable, indecipherable cipher, commonly named as Vigenere cipher. Basically, it's XOR but with multibyte key. There are a few ways to break it, but they all come 
down to frequency analysis. You need to have a model text for assuming the expected letter distribution - like, for example, lengthy fragment of some English text.

First you have to determine the key length by observing the coincidence index (Wikipedia). Once you have the length, 
you simply brute force each byte of the key in turn, looking for
a best correlation with model distribution of letters. So it's 
256*key length loop, not that much. The winning key is: whatdoiwin?
